# Enroll-O-Matic

Are you an enrollment management professional at an institution of higher education?  Have you been asked to control the overall enrollment by tuning the size of each newly enrolling cohort of students?  Have you not yet found an easy way to do this calculation?  Then Enroll-O-Matic is for you!

"How does Enroll-O-Matic work?" you may ask.  Good question!  There's no trick to it -- it's as easy as 1-2-3!  

1. Tell it the number of students currently enrolled in each year of your program.
2. Tell it your guess for the year-to-year retention rates.
3. Tell it the slope of the line you would like your overall enrollment to follow and for how long.

It's that easy!  Enroll-O-Matic will tell you exactly how many new students to enroll every year until the end of time!

Frequently Asked Questions:

* I'm a bad person who is interested in surriptitiously shrinking a large part of my university by driving its enrollments down.  Will Enroll-O-Matic help me?

Yes! You just have to tell Enroll-O-Matic how many students you want the total enrollment of that part your university to shrink by each year, and based on its current enrollment cohorts, Enroll-O-Matic will plan the size of every incoming class you'll need!

* But I'm worried that using Enroll-O-Matic to cause such a predictable-looking decrease in total enrollment might look suspicious. Should I be worried?

Not at all!  Nobody would think an enrollment professional would really try to do something so obviously damaging to your institution -- so you're in the clear!

* Will Enroll-O-Matic protect me if I lose my job for gross incompetence?

Next question!

* Could I use Enroll-O-Matic to *increase* enrollment?

Of course!  But why would you?

* But how is this sorcery even possible?  You expect me to believe you can determine exactly the right number of new enrollments will offset the number of seniors who graduate and the other students are not retained, even when these quantities are not yet known?

I do!  It's easy!  Retention rates don't vary a lot year by year, so Enroll-O-Matic just uses current-year already-measured retention rates to estimate *future* rates necessary to calculate just the right size of the new enrolled class. See?
